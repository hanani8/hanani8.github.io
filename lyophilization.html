            <h4>Lyophilization: </h4>
            Also known as Freeze-Drying, it is a process, commonly used in Food and Pharma Industries, to extend the
            lifespan of a product. They do this by removing all the water content in a product, by way of sublimation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Working Principle, as I understand it currently: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The product is placed in a well-sealed 'Chamber'. Each chamber has varied number of shelves, upon
                    which the products are placed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pipes are embedded in shelves or surrounding them, and these pipes contain a certain type of oil
                    with some special characteristics flowing through it - (i) Viscosity: Should easily flow throught
                    the pipes. (ii) Has freezing point well below the freezing point of the product[Lest the oil gets
                    frozen, and does not flow.]
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adjacent to the chamber lies 'Condenser'. The
                    Condenser and The Chamber are isolated by an isolation valve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Condenser has pipes attached to its walls[Just like in in rocket engines]. Inside these pipes, we
                    inject cool refrigerant liquid. The condenser also has a vaccum pump attached to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are 3 stages in a standard lyophilization process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Freezing
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Primary Drying
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Secondary Drying
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Freezing: </h4>
                    Before the oil in the container enters the chamber, we cool it down using the same refrigerant
                    liquid used in the condenser. Typically, we cool it down to -60C. Thus, freezing the product, and any
                    water content present in it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Primary Drying: </h4>
                    Keeping in mind the thermal characteristics of the product[This is part of the initial R&D
                    Process.], we raise the temperature of the chamber a little bit[-40C]. At the same time, the vaccum
                    pump is started in the condenser, and the isolation valve is opened. This step sublimates bulk ice
                    to watervapour.
                    <br>
                    My sources differed on what pulls the watervapour down to the condenser:
                    Some say Temperature Differential. Some say Pressure Differential.
                    <br>
                    Once the generated watervapour is pulled down into the condenser, it liquiefies because of the cool
                    refrigerant liquid contained in the condensor's pipes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Secondary Drying: </h4>
                    All the water content that was missed in the "Primary Drying", will be removed here.
