                        “Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?" Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into his mind "for every man must have somewhere to turn...”

                        “There is nothing in the world more difficult than candor, and nothing easier than flattery. If there is a hundredth of a fraction of a false note to candor, it immediately produces dissonance, and as a result, exposure. But in flattery, even if everything is false down to the last note, it is still pleasant, and people will listen not without pleasure; with coarse pleasure, perhaps, but pleasure nevertheless. ”

                        'formerly a freethinker was a man brought up with the ideas of religion, law, and morality, who himself, through struggle and pain, had attained freedom of thought; but now a new type of born freethinkers has appeared. These grow up without so much as hearing that there used to be laws of morality and religion, and there was once authority in these things; they grow up simply with the idea of negation - that is, as heathens.

                        She was a thin, sallow, nervous, ailing woman with shining black eyes. She was fond of Kitty, and her affection showed itself as the affection of a married woman for an unmarried one generally does, in a desire to get Kitty married according to her own ideal of conjugal bliss.(Chp:14)

                <p><em>Review: </em> 	
                    This book had and has a special meaning in my life. It was the first book I consciously read. It catapulted me into great forays of philosophy. The impact of it was such that I still assume Lomachenko Stance.</p>

The concept of "programmed instruction" is beautiful, and it should be used by all tutorial books.
The arrangement of chess problems in "frames", and having the solution on the next page instead of on the same page was very thoughtful.

The book solely concentrates on 1-3 move checkmates, back rank mates, back rank-mates defense.
