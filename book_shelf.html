                        “Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?" Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into his mind "for every man must have somewhere to turn...”

                        “There is nothing in the world more difficult than candor, and nothing easier than flattery. If there is a hundredth of a fraction of a false note to candor, it immediately produces dissonance, and as a result, exposure. But in flattery, even if everything
                        is false down to the last note, it is still pleasant, and people will listen not without pleasure; with coarse pleasure, perhaps, but pleasure nevertheless. ”

                        'formerly a freethinker was a man brought up with the ideas of religion, law, and morality, who himself, through struggle and pain, had attained freedom of thought; but now a new type of born freethinkers has appeared. These grow up without so much as
                        hearing that there used to be laws of morality and religion, and there was once authority in these things; they grow up simply with the idea of negation - that is, as heathens. (Part V, Chapter IX)

                        She was a thin, sallow, nervous, ailing woman with shining black eyes. She was fond of Kitty, and her affection showed itself as the affection of a married woman for an unmarried one generally does, in a desire to get Kitty married according to her own
                        ideal of conjugal bliss.(Chp:14)

                        "He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It's not hard to take a fortress, it's hard to win a campaign. And for that there's no need to storm and attack, there's need for <b>patience and time</b>. Kamesnky sent soldiers
                        to Rushchuck, but I, with just those two(patience and time), took more fotresses than Kamensky and made the Turks eat horse-flesh." He shook his head. "And the French will, too! Take my word for it". Kutuzov said, becoming animated
                        and beating his chest, "they'll eat horseflesh"

                        He won't have anything of his own. He won't invent, won't undertake anything. But he'll listen to everything, remeber everything, put everything in its place, won't hinder anything useful or allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something
                        stronger and more significant than his will - the inevitable course of events - and he's able to see them, able to understand their significance, and, in view of that significance, is able to renounce participating in those events,
                        renounce his personal will and direct it elsewhere.

                        All evening Nikolai paid most attention to blue-eyed, plump and sweet-looking blonde, the wife of one of the provinvial officials. With the naive convtion of young men making merry, that other men's wives were created for them, Rostov never left this
                        lady's side.

                <em>Review: </em> The concept of "programmed instruction" is beautiful, and it should be used by all tutorial books. The arrangement of chess problems in "frames", and having the solution on the next page instead of on the same page was
                very thoughtful. The book solely concentrates on 1-3 move checkmates, back rank mates, back rank-mates defense.
