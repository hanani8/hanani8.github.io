    Profound sentences written on the concept of 'KITSCH'.

          Where the coverage has not been an objective coverage of an event, but
          this sort of forced recruitment of everybody into the same emotional
          mold. A great titanic outpouring of <em>kitsch</em>. Everyone is told
          that they're all part of a great 'We', and this great 'We' feels both
          bound together, and enormously moved, and hurt, by something that
          actually is a non-event.

          Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear
          says: How nice to see children running on the grass! The second tear
          says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children
          running on the grass!

          She knew only too well that the song was a beautiful lie. As soon as
          kitsch is recognized for the lie it is, it moves into the context of
          non-kitsch, thus losing its authoritarian power and becoming as
          touching as any other human weakness. For none among us is superman
          enough to escape kitsch completely. No matter how we scorn it, kitsch
          is an integral part of the human condition.

          You certainly remember this scene from dozens of films: a boy and a
          girl are running hand in hand in a beautiful spring (or summer)
          landscape. Running, running, running, and laughing. By laughing the
          two runners are proclaiming to the whole world, to audiences in all
          the movie theaters: "We're happy, we're glad to be in the world, we're
          in agreement with being!" It's a silly scene, a cliche, but it
          expresses a basic human attitude: serious laughter, laughter "beyond
          joking." All churches, all underwear manufacturers, all generals, all
          political parties, are in agreement about that kind of laughter, and
          all of them rush to put the image of the two laughing runners on the
          billboards advertising their religion, their products, their ideology,
          their nation, their sex, their dishwashing powder.

          "behind Communism, Fascism, behind all occupations and invasions lurks
          a more basic, pervasive evil and that the image of that evil was a
          parade of people marching by with raised fists and shouting identical
          syllables in unison" (3.5.8). Now we know what that pervasive evil is:
          totalitarian kitsch.

          The beautiful lie is, however, also the essence of kitsch. Kitsch is a
          form of make-believe, a form of deception. It is an alternative to a
          daily reality that would otherwise be a spiritual vacuum. . . . Kitsch
          replaces ethics with aesthetics. . . . Nazism was the ultimate
          expression of kitsch, of its mind-numbing, death-dealing portent.
          Nazism, like kitsch, masqueraded as life; the reality of both was
          death. The Third Reich was the creation of “kitsch men,” people who
          confused the relationship between life and art, reality and myth, and
          who regarded the goal of existence as mere affirmation, devoid of
          criticism, difficulty, insight.

          A taste for kitsch among the well-to-do is a sign of spiritual
          impoverishment; but among the poor, it represents a striving for
          beauty, an aspiration without the likelihood of fulfillment.
